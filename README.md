# IRProject16

This is a maven project. <br />
The easiest way to try it out is by using Eclipse and follow the wizard (```Import -> Existing Maven Project...```).

### Resources needed
To make it work, some resources are needed: 

1. ```tweetKey.txt``` <br />
  Here you have to put all your Twitter keys (one-per-line)
  
2. ```newsKey.txt``` <br />
  Here you simple put your news API key
  
3. ``` usernames.txt``` <br />
  Here you list some twitter usernames (again one-per-line). 

These files must be put in the ```src\main\resources``` directory and are obviously git-ignored.

The file containing **stopwords**, instead, is already included (in the same dir). You can modify it as you wish.
